1-This folder contains 2python runnable files.
-> augmentation
-> traverse_and_make_better

2-augmentation file takes dataset from the set directory and places it in the "train_and_test_dataset_own_4x" folder by adding images which are tilted by 90 degrees and 180 degrees.

3-Traverse_and_make_better file creates a filter in image which takes canges every pixel value
Let us say we have image(RGB) coordinate of (i,j) than it takes darkest tone from (i,j-1) (i,j+1),(i-1,j),(i+1,j). The program places the new modified images in the dataset "train_test_dataset_own" folder from the set directory
